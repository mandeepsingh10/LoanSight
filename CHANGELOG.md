## [Unreleased]

### Changed

#### Schema Changes:
- ❌ None (frontend-only changes)

#### Backup/Restore Impact:
- ❌ None (frontend-only changes)

#### Key Logic Changes:

**Issue #1 - Defaulted Loans Not Removed from Defaulter Lists:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only checked payment status, ignored loan status
payments.forEach((payment: any) => {
  if (payment.status === "collected") return;
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Added loan status check
payments.forEach((payment: any) => {
  if (payment.status === "collected") return;
  
  const borrower = borrowers.find((b: any) => b.loan?.id === payment.loanId);
  if (!borrower) return;
  
  // Skip if the borrower's loan is marked as completed
  if (borrower.loan?.status === 'completed') return;
  
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

**Changes Made:**
- Added loan status checks to exclude completed loans from defaulter lists
- Modified defaulter detection logic to consider loan completion status

**Issue #2 - Defaulter Status Priority Logic:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Excluded borrowers with completed loans from defaulter lists
payments.forEach((payment: any) => {
  if (payment.status === "collected") return;
  
  const borrower = borrowers.find((b: any) => b.loan?.id === payment.loanId);
  if (!borrower) return;
  
  // Skip if the borrower's loan is marked as completed
  if (borrower.loan?.status === 'completed') return;
  
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Include borrowers with defaulted loans (prioritize defaulter over completed)
payments.forEach((payment: any) => {
  if (payment.status === "collected") return;
  
  const borrower = borrowers.find((b: any) => b.loan?.id === payment.loanId);
  if (!borrower) return;
  
  // Only skip if the loan is completed and not defaulted
  if (borrower.loan?.status === 'completed' && borrower.loan?.status !== 'defaulted') return;
  
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

**Changes Made:**
- Changed logic to prioritize defaulter status over completed status
- Updated defaulter detection to include borrowers who have any defaulted loans
- Modified the condition to only exclude completed loans that are not also defaulted
- Updated all defaulter-related components to use consistent logic

**Issue #3 - Dashboard Total Amount Calculation:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Included all loans in total amount
for (const loan of allLoans) {
  totalAmount += loan.amount;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Exclude completed loans from total amount
for (const loan of allLoans) {
  if (loan.status !== 'completed') {
    totalAmount += loan.amount;
  }
}
```

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `getDashboardStats()` function to exclude completed loans from total amount
- Updated total amount calculation to only include active, defaulted, and cancelled loans

#### Code Examples:

*Note: Code examples are now included in the "Key Logic Changes" section above for each issue.*

#### Result:
- ✅ When a loan is marked as "completed", it will not be shown as "defaulted"
- ✅ If a borrower has multiple loans and ANY of them are defaulted, they will be shown as a defaulter
- ✅ Defaulter status takes priority over completed status
- ✅ Individual loans that are defaulted will show as "defaulted" even if the borrower has other completed loans
- ✅ Dashboard total amount now excludes completed loans, showing only active outstanding amounts
