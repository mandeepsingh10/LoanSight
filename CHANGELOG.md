## [Unreleased]

## [2024-12-19] - Defaulter Logic Fixes

### Added
- Enhanced defaulter detection logic to consider loan status
- Added loan status priority logic (defaulter over completed)

### Changed
- Updated defaulter detection to prioritize defaulter status over completed status
- Modified StatusBadge logic to show correct loan status
- Updated all defaulter-related components to use consistent logic

### Fixed
- **Issue #1:** Defaulted loans not being removed from defaulter lists when marked as completed
- **Issue #2:** Incorrect priority logic where completed loans were taking precedence over defaulted loans

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified:
1. `client/src/pages/defaulters-new.tsx`
2. `client/src/components/dashboard/RecentDefaulters.tsx`
3. `client/src/components/borrowers/BorrowerTable.tsx`
4. `client/src/components/borrowers/LoanHistory.tsx`
5. `client/src/pages/defaulters.tsx`

#### Schema Changes:
- ❌ None (frontend-only changes)

#### Backup/Restore Impact:
- ❌ None (frontend-only changes)

#### Key Logic Changes:

**Issue #1 - Defaulted Loans Not Removed from Defaulter Lists:**
- Added loan status checks to exclude completed loans from defaulter lists
- Modified defaulter detection logic to consider loan completion status

**Issue #2 - Defaulter Status Priority Logic:**
- Reversed logic to prioritize defaulter status over completed status
- Updated `hasDefaultedLoans()` function to consider any defaulted loan as sufficient for defaulter status
- Modified `isDefaulter()` function to check for defaulted loans first
- Updated StatusBadge logic to show "defaulted" status when applicable

#### Code Examples:

**Before (Issue #1):**
```typescript
// Only checked payment status, ignored loan status
payments.forEach((payment: any) => {
  if (payment.status === "collected") return;
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

**After (Issue #1):**
```typescript
// Added loan status check
payments.forEach((payment: any) => {
  if (payment.status === "collected") return;
  
  const borrower = borrowers.find((b: any) => b.loan?.id === payment.loanId);
  if (!borrower) return;
  
  // Skip if the borrower's loan is marked as completed
  if (borrower.loan?.status === 'completed') return;
  
  // ... rest of logic
});
```

**Before (Issue #2):**
```typescript
// Prioritized completed over defaulter
const hasDefaultedLoans = (borrower: BorrowerWithLoans) => {
  if (borrower.loans.some(loan => loan.status === 'completed')) return false;
  return borrower.loans.some(loan => loan.status === 'defaulted' || isLoanDefaulter(loan.id));
};
```

**After (Issue #2):**
```typescript
// Prioritizes defaulter over completed
const hasDefaultedLoans = (borrower: BorrowerWithLoans) => {
  return borrower.loans.some(loan => loan.status === 'defaulted' || isLoanDefaulter(loan.id));
};
```

#### Result:
- ✅ When a loan is marked as "completed", it will not be shown as "defaulted"
- ✅ If a borrower has multiple loans and ANY of them are defaulted, they will be shown as a defaulter
- ✅ Defaulter status takes priority over completed status
- ✅ Individual loans that are defaulted will show as "defaulted" even if the borrower has other completed loans
